It's the empanada guy
The empanada guy
Holy *. Damn it  Toby
No  I wasn't asking you.
Ask him if he
remembers Jim
No
He says no
He says no. Boom
Yeah  but who remembers
all their customers?
I mean  I can name
like three of our clients
He remembers Toby the most
forgettable man in the known world
He doesn't want
any trouble.
He sees lots of people
they come from all around to eat
his delicious meat pockets.
Uh  you guys are going to love
these  so empanadas on me
You guys got to try them
Usually I'm a burrito guy but if you
won't tell  I won't. Wink  wink.
Great And while we're enjoying
these delicious empanadas
Jim  why don't you
tell us your story again?
Why? Everybody's heard it
Walk us through it
What time would you get
there every morning?
Hey  Murder  She Wrote
how about we drop the whole
Murder  She Wrote thing  okay?
Jim was at the courthouse
for jury duty every morning
How do I know?
Because I drove him there
Why?
Why?
Why?
Because my car broke down
His car broke down
so he called me
because I live
near the courthouse
Wait  wait
you live by the courthouse
You drove from near the
courthouse out to Jim's house
and then back to
the courthouse?
Thirty minutes out 30
minutes back easy hour.
And I would watch
that cute  little tooshy
scurry up those courthouse
stairs every morning
and that was that
I'm sorry  do you have
any American Mexican food?
We're getting
buried out there
What was that stuff about
the car breaking down?
Well  I think you
handled it pretty well
I'm not Rumpelstiltskin  Jim  I can't
keep spinning gold out of your *
Okay  listen  all right?
Dwight's onto us. He's going
to figure it out really soon
So let's just get ahead of it.
Let's tell the truth
I don't even know what
the truth is anymore.
Wow  it's so
healthy
I'm going to call
him Little Kevin
No  you will not
Is he really five pounds? Because
I squat with five pounds
This
Yeah  this feels like
more than that
No  no  no he's nine
pounds seven ounces.
Nine pounds? Really?
I thought you said five You know what?
I was under so many drugs
a James Taylor concert
or something
So  what did you bring?
Oh  yeah  I don't know
if it's right  but...
Well  if it's anything like
that gorgeous wrapping paper
you hit it
out of the park
Oh
Preemie pajamas
Again  it may not be
the right size  I can
No  I think he came early
just so he could wear these
Thank you
Call of Duty.
This baby is
clearly not premature
They're lying about
the date it was conceived
It's very interesting
And her husband's gay I don't
even know which thread to follow.
Uh  excuse me  can I have
everyone's attention for a second?
First off  I just want to
say that I'm really sorry
I didn't know that
my absence last week
would have been
a burden on any of you
Because  though I did
have jury duty last week
they did dismiss me
early on Monday.
And I think you're going to
find this pretty hilarious.
I kind of  well
maybe took the week off
What?
Funny? No? Nobody laughed
You're screwed
Oh! It's happening.
It's really happening
What the hell  Jim I
covered for your bony butt
Pam really needed some help
with the kids  so...
I promise my
intentions were good
Your clients
they're all mine
Jim  I got my ass chewed out because
one of your orders got messed up.
And Andy  you said you drove
him to the courthouse
Uh  I did
Every morning And if I
didn't then I hope I die
All right  well  let's get this
show on the road  shall we?
Allow me to give you
a hand Here we are.
So long  clump mate
I'm going to miss you
Truth be told
I never thought that this
was how it was going to end
I was going to
defeat you somehow
but you've
defeated yourself
Dwight  cut it out
I'm not firing Jim.
No  no  no  no
you said...
ANDY
I know what I said
Jim  you're in deep
doo-doo you understand?
And I have one
thing to say to you
and I'm going to say it in
front of this whole office
Look me in the eye
That's it?
This is crap
You've reached Gabe Lewis.
I'm currently indisposed.
Leave me a message. Ciao.
Gabe  it's Dwight again
Highest priority
triple urgent.
Call me immediately
That means ASAP
I'm going to find Gabe
tell him what Jim did
and let the little stickler
do what he does best  stickle
Honestly  I can return
this for a larger size
It's fine Pajamas aren't
supposed to be baggy  right?
It's not the barrio
The only premature baby in this
room is the baby this baby ate
Little Kevin
Really?
Angela
Fine. God
Philip was conceived
nine months ago.
The Senator and I
wanted to wait
but we had just seen Thor
and there was way too much
wine in my chicken piccata
Chicken marsala
Right
And  the point is  Philip was
conceived out of wedlock
Hmm
And now you all know
but you can never tell
I'm serious
Dwight
Hey
Oh. Hey  have you
seen Gabe?
He went to the car or
something but he'll be back.
Okay
Don't you want
to see the baby?
Why? I know what Angela
and the Senator look like
I can mash that up
in my head right now
wouldn't tell
So don't
Angela got pregnant
before the wedding.
What?
She got pregnant
before the wedding
How long before?
A month
You didn't hear it
from me
Yes  I did
Dwight?
Dwight.
Well  Angela will make you cut
your fingernails It's not worth it
Oh
Yes
Oh
What a beautiful child Prominent
forehead  short arms  tiny nose.
You will lead millions
willingly or as slaves
That baby is a Schrute  and
unless somebody taught Mose sex
that baby is mine
He's hungry
Oh  that's my cue
to leave.
No  you don't have to I'm
going to wear this cover.
Still
You won't be seeing
Do you want the giraffe?
Yes  I am bringing my kids in to
help me get out of this hole.

be more excited to be here
Whoa  whoa  whoa Game face  baby.

He's licking on my finger
just like my cat does.
Let me have a turn
No  it's
the pacifier's turn
All right
Did you say
something about
this one bringing in
something for these people?
Yes. Cece wanted
to thank everybody
for letting her daddy stay home
with her all last week and play
so she brought
you a little treat
Oh  cookies?
No. But that would have
been a really good idea
That would have
been really good
