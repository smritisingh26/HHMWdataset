# HoldOnHoneyMenAtWork: ACL SRW 2021

This repository consists of the proposed dataset D_final, as in my paper. The dataset consists of annotated sexist and neutral dialogue turns from popular sitcoms that have aired between 1989 to 2021.
In case anyone is interested in the code or other discussions relating to this research paper, please feel free to hit me up at smritisingh26@yahoo.com.
